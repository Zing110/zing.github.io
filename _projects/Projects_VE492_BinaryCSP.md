This Project aims to implement Binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem using python.

# Binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem (BinaryCSP)

A **Binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem (BinaryCSP)** is a type of **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** where every constraint involves exactly two variables. In a BinaryCSP, the goal is to find assignments for the variables that satisfy all the binary constraints. These problems are often represented as a graph where:
- Each variable is a node.
- Each edge represents a binary constraint between two variables.

### Key Features:
- **Binary Constraints**: Each constraint involves two variables and defines valid value pairs for them.
- **Graph Representation**: The problem can be modeled as a graph where edges represent binary constraints between nodes (variables).
- **Solution Objective**: The objective is to assign values to all variables such that all constraints are satisfied.

### Applications:
BinaryCSPs are widely used in various fields such as:
- **Scheduling**: Assigning tasks or resources without conflicts.
- **Graph Coloring**: Ensuring adjacent nodes have different colors.
- **Puzzle Solving**: For problems like Sudoku or N-Queens.

Solving BinaryCSPs efficiently often involves techniques such as backtracking, constraint propagation, and heuristics.

### Implementation:
