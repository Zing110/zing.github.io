I'm a senior undergraduate student from [ECE Department](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/), [SJTU-JI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, 3D reconstruction, machine learning, and robotics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Youyi Bi](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/youyibi) of Data-informed Design and Intelligent Systems Lab from [SJTU-UM Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/). I was also advised by [Prof. Yutong Ban](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/75745/) from [SJTU-UM Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/).
